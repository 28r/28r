### Why, hello there! 

- 👨🏼‍🎓 I’m a senior at Seoul National University
- 🌎 I'm currently majoring in IR and I'm due to graduate in June 2023.
- 👨🏻‍💻 In late 2021/early 2022, while on break, I completed Harvard University's CS50 course on edX,
- ⌨️ which I then found to be an exciting introduction to programming, 
- 🛠 by way of C, Python, SQL and a couple others.
- 🏃🏻‍♂️ So, I figured I'd hit the ground running and give The Odin Project a shot.
- 🍝 Some of my spaghetti code up from that is here (hope it doesn't give you a stomachache!),
- 😞 but sadly I had to spend some time away from coding due to other tasks.
- 🍀 Now I want to come back, so wish me luck!
