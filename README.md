### Hey ✌🏼

- 👨🏼‍🎓 I’m a junior at Seoul National University
- 🌎 I'm currently majoring in IR and I'm due to graduate in 2023.
- 👨🏻‍💻 Recently, while on break, I completed Harvard University's CS50 course on edX,
- ⌨️ which I've found to be a remarkably exciting introduction to programming.
- 🏃🏻‍♂️ So, I figured I'd hit the ground running and give The Odin Project a shot before my classes started again in March.
- 🍝 Naturally, I'll be putting my spaghetti code up here as I complete projects. 

Hope it doesn't scare you too bad!
